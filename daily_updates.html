            For our first rehearsal, we started out with a company meeting! I got to meet the cast and I am gradually learning everyone's names. We went over general rules and received our music scores. After that, we had our first music rehearsal in which we learned almost all of the music for the show that involves everyone. <br><br>From there, the Cratchit family split off to work on the songs that pertain only to the seven of us. We stopped for lunch a hair early, which gave the three of us (Mac aka Francis, Sasha aka Tiny Tim, and myself) time to do some homework before heading off to a favorite tradition of ours: the annual chili feed! <br><br>Each year, the staff at the Omaha Community Playhouse makes several Crock Pots full of chili to feed everyone in the building, and there are veggies and desserts and cornbread and Fritos. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! <br><br>Following the massive amounts of chili, everyone met back up to have a dialect session with one of our directors, Jeff Horger. Fun Fact- did you know that the difference between a dialect and an accent are that a dialect is in the actual language and refers to how you speak that language whereas an accent is how your native language affects the language you are speaking in (which is most likely a second or third language)? I didn't know that. <br><br>Next, we talked through the Cratchit scenes. We discussed the meaning behind some of the lines, and how certain things can be inferred about the family based on the way things are worded in the text. <br><br>From 4:00 - 4:30, the whole cast was back in the rehearsal hall learning the last bit of music from the entire show. We sang the closing number to close our first day of rehearsals.

            Today was a pretty easy going day. We just had an hour of rehearsal that started at 4 (so I didn't miss any school), and we just visited over some Cratchit things, including our Christmas Yet To Come scenes and our Christmas Present scenes.

        To start off rehearsals today, we began with a scene from Christmas Past, where Scrooge sees his sister and friends singing carols together. <br> Between working on Christmas Past and our next scene, Sasha, Mac and I filled out our Secret Scrooge forms! Secret Scrooge is an optional game of Secret Santa that the cast plays every year, and this year our chaperone, Brittany, is getting in on the fun and playing, too! <br> I had enough down time where I could go back up to Marian for the last few classes of the day before trying to make it back to the theater in time for our third Cratchit family meeting. Throughout reviewing scenes we've finished blocking and learning the the new ones, the 7 of us Cratchits decided that we are going to create a special family handshake. We haven't started putting it together yet, but I will be sure to post about it when we do!

            Today started off with a block of time where I could go to school and take a handful of tests. Rehearsal didn't start until 2:00, so I was able to get a lot of my school work done AT school :). When we did start rehearsal, we jumped straight into one of my favorite scenes: Counting House! The Counting House scene is where Scrooge is trying to work peacefully in his shop, when a group of kids come in and ask for money. The kids know that he hates children, and the scream and run around the shop as he chases them back out to the street.

            Happy Street Scene Day! Today is the day in which we learn all of the Street Scenes! The Street Scenes are the scenes in which everyone is on stage at once, and each person has a set track that they have to follow. These paths have been perfected so that no one is hit by any moving scenery or run into by anyone else. This is one of my favorite days in the rehearsal period.

            After having Sunday, November 12, off, we officially move into Omaha South High School for rehearsals. From now until the end of the rehearsal process, we will be at South with full set as we gradually add in props and costumes. Today, all we did was make sure that set pieces were spiked correctly and that there was enough room for the scene to happen within the given space. I will try to start adding more pictures now that we have more time between scenes!

            I have more pictures! This morning, we are brushing up on Street Scenes with the full set in place. It's a little weird having the change of spacing, but I'm super excited that the show is coming together so well! I am looking forward to this afternoon, because we are going to start teching the show! We are going to do a start-and-stop run of the show to make sure we have all of the pieces of the show set in place.

            Happy Tech! Today, we started officially teching the show! That means that we started adding in some of the elements that we havenâ€™t seen in the rehearsal process yet, such as lighting and dry ice. This morning, we ran a stop-and-start of act 2 before taking a lunch break. Since we got through with our morning rehearsals early, we were able take an extra long lunch break! Brittany (the best chaperone ever) let us walk to Jacobo's (a little grocery store down the street from the theater) so we could pick up some chips and salsa to go with our lunches. After eating lunch, we had enough time to play a couple card games with some of the adult actors. After I was defeated in two card games in a row, we jumped into our first full run through of the show! <br> Rehearsal ended at about 5pm, which left just enough time to get dinner before the cast went to see the Mainstage version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL perform at OCP! Overall, it was a wonderful day.

            We are now less than one week away from departure! Today we are running the show with all of the technical elements, which includes (but isn't limited to) having the lights run through their program, sound effects, microphones, lanterns, dry ice, and Spook! "Spook" is what we call Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. He's pretty spooky :). This afternoon, though, is when things really get crazy! This afternoon is when we start using costumes! I can't wait!

            After our first dress rehearsal, it was decided that we would have today's morning rehearsal be without costumes so that our costumers could fix all of the little things that needed adjustments before our next run through. During lunch, the four of us went over to Subway to get some sandwiches, and then we walked to the international bakery for some pastries! <br> From there, we had our second dress rehearsal. This one had a few bumps in the road, but we were able to get the problems solved in a way so that if they do happen on the road, we know how to fix them without stopping the show. I almost forgot to mention- I have been keeping up with my homework at the theater! Whether I'm sprawled out on the floor or tucked in a corner on one of the couches, I will always find time to finish a math worksheet :)

            What happens when you have a company of actors and technicians who have just had an amazing third dress rehearsal and want to celebrate together before having a fantastic preview the next day? A cast party, that's what! Tonight was the first official cast party for A CHRISTMAS CAROL, and it was a blast! A few of us wore Christmas sweaters, and I have to say, the three of us kids all have great taste in what is considered an "ugly" Christmas sweater. One of my castmates attached her phone to the speaker in the room so we could stream Christmas music from her spotify. My favorite part was when 'All I Want For Christmas' came on over the speaker, and everyone in the room looked at each other and came to the silent conclusion that, in that moment, we were all Mariah Carey. I have never seen so many people sing that song at once, especially making up harmonies to go with it. Everyone knew all of the words, and we all just had a blast. We were eventually kicked out of the room we were using for our party in the basement of the Playhouse, and the adults continued the party at a local bar and grill while the three of us kids went our separate ways. Tonight was so much fun, and I hope that the rest of the tour goes the same way!

            Today, we had one last company meeting before we hit the road. We went over rules for the bus, call times, how load in and load out is going to work, and other things like why it is important not to bring tuna onto the bus. We found out that we will be getting our road books on Tuesday. Our road books consist of everywhere we will be stopping, what our call times and ETAs are, and how everything will fit together. Our road manager was kind enough to put in there what restaurants are nearby and if there are washing machines available in the hotel. <br> After running through curtain call one last time, we opened the house for our preview performance! This is the last time that we will be using set/costumes in South. We invited friends and family (although we were limited to 10 tickets each so I couldn't invite everyone I had wanted to), and the house was almost at capacity! The warm welcome was a great way to kick off our tour.
